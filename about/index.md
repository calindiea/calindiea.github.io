# Hello, I'm Diea Calin 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** based in **Bucharest, Romania**, currently 26 years old, working with data systems and financial applications.

## 🚀 What I Do

I currently work as a Data Engineer, designing Databricks-based solutions for end-to-end batch ingestion from files and databases. I implement ELT pipelines using the Medallion Architecture, ingesting data into Bronze, working with business stakeholders to define data and validation rules, and designing transformations that serve the Gold layer.

Before moving into data, I worked as a Web Developer, starting with PHP on websites and web modules for healthcare, transport, and financial systems, then expanding into Node.js and React. I later moved into GenAI, where I built RAG applications for document understanding and coding assistants, including custom chunking mechanisms. These systems initially used Oracle Autonomous Database as a vector store and later expanded to Azure and Google Cloud, giving me solid hands-on experience with cloud platforms and services.

I eventually transitioned from AI to what enables it—data. My background across web, AI, cloud, and data allows me to work comfortably as a consultant with diverse clients and technologies. While I may not always have the immediate answer, I bring ownership, adaptability, and a strong willingness to learn, and I’m comfortable proposing solutions and growing regardless of the tech stack.
